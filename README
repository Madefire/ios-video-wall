The code found here was used to be an iPad Video Wall for the Madefire booth at
Comic-Con San Diego. More information can be found in the following blog post:

The code is provided as-is. It's not pretty, what would you expect form a day
and a half of hacking around to get it to work, but it got the job done.
Patches/improvements welcomed.
